     "context": "chinese characters are logograms used in the writing of chinese and some other asian languages. in standard chinese they are called hanzi (simplified chinese: \u6c49\u5b57; traditional chinese: \u6f22\u5b57). they have been adapted to write a number of other languages including: japanese, where they are known as kanji, korean, where they are known as hanja, and vietnamese in a system known as ch\u1eef n\u00f4m. collectively, they are known as cjkv characters. in english, they are sometimes called han characters. chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. by virtue of their widespread current use in east asia, and historic use throughout the sinosphere, chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world.  chinese characters number in the tens of thousands, though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts. studies in china have shown that functional literacy in written chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters. in japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the j\u014dy\u014d kanji); hundreds more are in everyday use. there are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations. simplified forms of certain characters are used in china, singapore, and malaysia; the corresponding traditional characters are used in taiwan, hong kong, macau, and to a limited extent in south korea. in japan, common characters are written in post-wwii japan-specific simplified forms (shinjitai), which are closer to traditional forms than chinese simplifications, while uncommon characters are written in japanese traditional forms (ky\u016bjitai), which are virtually identical to chinese traditional forms. in south korea, when chinese characters are used they are of the traditional variant and are almost identical to those used in places like taiwan and hong kong. teaching of chinese characters in south korea starts in the 7th grade and continues until the 12th grade where 1,800 total characters are taught albeit these characters are only used in certain cases (on signs, academic papers, historical writings, etc.) and are slowly declining in use.",
