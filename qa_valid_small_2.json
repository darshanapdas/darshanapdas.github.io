     "context": "satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.  a feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm\u2014\"in satire, irony is militant\"\u2014but parody, burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. this \"militant\" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack.  satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including internet memes, literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics.  the word satire comes from the latin word \"satur\" and the subsequent phrase \".\" \"satur\" meant \"full\" but the juxtaposition with \"lanx\" shifted the meaning to \"miscellany or medley\": the expression \"lanx satura\" literally means \"a full dish of various kinds of fruits.\"  the word \"satura\" as used by quintilian, however, was used to denote only roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed hexameter form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as \"satire\". quintilian famously said that \"satura,\" that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly roman origin (\"satura tota nostra est\"). he was aware of and commented on greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be aristophanes' old comedy. the first critic to use the term \"satire\" in the modern broader sense was apuleius.",
